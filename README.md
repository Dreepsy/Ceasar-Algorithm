Hello :)

this ist just a little Encrypting/Decrypting project.
It takes a user input, encrypts it, writes it into a file "Password.txt" and then a second little program read's the file and decrypts it again.
Did this just to get more comfortable with file mainpulation in C.

Feel free to optimise as you please.
